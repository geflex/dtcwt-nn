Time domain gear fault vibration data (DataForClassification_TimeDomain)
and
Gear fault data after angle-frequency domain synchronous analysis (DataForClassification_Stage0)

Number of gear fault types=9={'healthy','missing','crack','spall','chip5a','chip4a','chip3a','chip2a','chip1a'}
Number of samples per type=104
Number of total samples=9x104=936
The data are collected in sequence, the first 104 samples are healthy, 105th ~208th samples are missing, etc.
